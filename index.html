		<p>
			BayesDB, a Bayesian database table, lets users query the probable implications of their tabular data as easily as an SQL database lets them query the data itself. Using the built-in Bayesian Query Language (BQL), users with no statistics training can solve basic data science problems, such as detecting predictive relationships between variables, inferring missing values, simulating probable observations, and identifying statistically similar database entries.

			<h3>Fill in missing data</h3>
			<pre>INFER salary FROM mytable WHERE age > 30 WITH CONFIDENCE 0.95;</pre>
			<p>Fill in missing data with the <code>INFER</code> command. Unlike a traditional regression model, where you need to separately train a supervised model for each column you're interested in predicting, <code>INFER</code> statements are flexible and work with any set of columns to predict.
