# Dartmouth Atlas of Health

## Recording the cost structure, capacity and quality of care of US hospitals.

One of the main concerns in American health care is addressing *unwarranted variations* in quality: a disparity between the cost and outcomes of care. The cost-care disparity is well-documented mainly as a result of the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, a freely available dataset which

>...uses Medicare data to provide information and analysis about national, regional, and local markets, as well as hospitals and their affiliated physicians

Where initially, these findings were produced and reported by teams of researchers after months of work, we shall use BayesDB to verify these results in a few commands.

### Unwarranted variations in aggregate

First, we create a btable and load in pre-computed models,

    CREATE BTABLE dha FROM dha.csv;
    LOAD MODELS dha_models.pkl.gz INTO dha;

The first thing to do is to is get a general sense of the data by creating a column dependence probability matrix in which each cell represents a pair of variables and the value represents the probability of their being statistically dependent under the inferred CrossCat model.

    ESTIMATE PAIRWISE DEPENDENCE PROBABILITY FROM dha SAVE TO dha_z.png;

![Dartmouth Atlas of Health z-matrix]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cs_dha/dha_z.png)

Notice that quality and cost show no dependence.  We can list the variables that share the most dependence with quality,

    ESTIMATE COLUMNS FROM dha ORDER BY DEPENDENCE PROBABILITY WITH qual_score LIMIT 10

|      column     | desc dependence probability with qual_score |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
|    ami_score    |                  1.0                        |
|    qual_score   |                  1.0                        |
|   pneum_score   |                  1.0                        |
|    chf_score    |                  1.0                        |
|  mdcr_spnd_eqp  |                0.546875                     |
| eqp_copay_p_dcd |                0.546875                     |
|  mdcr_spnd_home |                  0.5                        |
| hha_visit_p_dcd |                  0.5                        |
|  mdcr_spnd_hspc |                0.34375                      |
|  pct_dths_hspc  |                0.34375                      |

It appears that the other `_score` variables and quality score are dependent related and Medicare expenditures, deaths, and days show a weak dependence probability with the quality score.

### Unwarranted variations on a per-town basis

Which hospitals are most anomalous? This is, which hospitals have the least probable quality scores given their other features?

Here McAllen, Texas has a predictive probability that is among the lowest. 
McAllen is a notoriously odd town when it comes to healthcare. In fact, the oddness of McAllen has been documented by the popular press ([The NewYorker](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande), [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-town-at-center-of-healthcare-debate/) and [NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/10/152417875/recalculating-the-health-bill-in-mcallen-texas)).

#General Social Survey

##Responses to ~5500 demographic, behavioral and attitudinal questions by US residents.

According to economics research, homeowners engage more in community activities than renters. They are also more likely to vote, more likely to know the names of the local political representatives, and more likely to engage in civic activities  (DiPasquale, D., &amp; Glaeser, E. L., 1999). For this reason, homeowners have been labeled better citizens (DiPasquale, D., &amp; Glaeser, E. L., 1999; McCabe, 2013). 

We will revisit this analysis, making use of the General Social Survey (GSS). The GSS is a sociological survey that collects data on the demographic characteristics and attitudes of US residents. Among other things, it includes information on homeownership, moral attitudes, and criminal variables. We have started by loading a subset of the GSS data into BayesDB, created a btable, and analyzed the data. 

<!-- The General Social Survey (GSS) is a collection of demographic data as well as data on the social, moral, and political attitudes of Americans. 

We've already created a btable, `gss_pared`, from a subset of the full GSS dataset and analyzed the data.
-->

## Are homeowners more likely to vote?

First we'll check whether the homeowners of 2012, like their predecessors, are more likely to vote than renters. Since we're using the 2012 GSS we'll investigate the relationship between `vote08` and `dwelown` variables. `vote08` is a categorical variable, where `1` indicates that the respondent voted in the 2008 presidential election, while `0` indicates that the did not. `dwelown` is also a categorical variable where `1` indicates that the respondent owns their home, and `2` indicates that the respondent rents their home.

First, for homeowners (`dwelown=1`),

    PLOT SELECT vote08 FROM gss_pared where dwelown=1 SAVE TO votedwel_1.png;


<center>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cs_gss/votedwel_1.png" class="img-med" alt="Vote variable plotted for homeowners">
</center>


and second, for renters (`dwelown=2`)

    PLOT SELECT vote08 FROM gss_pared where dwelown=2 SAVE TO votedwel_2.png;


<center>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cs_gss/votedwel_2.png" class="img-med" alt="Vote variable plotted for homeowners">
</center>


We see that 75% of homeowners voted while only 50% of renters voted, confirming the previous finding.

#Early Childhood Longitudinal Study

##Relationships among demographic, social, and experiential variables and early achievement 

What kinds of early childhood environments are associated with improved educational outcomes? The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (Kindergarten class) looks at a variety of variables---cultural, socioeconomic, and educational---as they relate to early proficiency in reading and mathematics. Research has found that sometimes simple things, such as the number of books in the home, have surprisingly strong associations with educational achievement (Evans, Kelley, Sikora, & Trieman, 2010). We investigate this finding using ECLs dataset using BayesDB. 

Our first step is to look at which variables are related to outcomes. Here, we will focus on children's kindergarten math scores.

| p2homecm |            0.770833333333            |
| p1expect |                 0.75                 |
|   race   |                 0.75                 |
| p2safepl |            0.729166666667            |
| p1prmlng |            0.729166666667            |
| p2depres |                0.6875                |
| p1chlboo |            0.666666666667            |
| p1chlaud |            0.666666666667            |

After other math and reading scores, there are a collection of variables whose relationship to outcomes is rather intuitive. These include the mother and father's education levels and expectations for child's education level, `wkmomed`, `wkmomed`, `p1expect`, poverty level, `wkpov_r`, parents' race and language, `race` and `p1prmlng`, and whether a parent is depressed `p2depres`. However, for a small group of findings, it is less clear how they are related to math achievement. These include having a home computer, `p2homecm`, the number of books in the house, `p1chlboo`, and the number of CDs and tapes in the house, `p1chlaud`. 

To investigate this further, we can explore how different values of each variable affect math scores. We will simulate predicted math scores given very small numbers of CDs and books (zero in each case), and given relatively large numbers of CDs and books (100 and 200, respectively). We have superimposed each pair of figures to compare the results

    PLOT SIMULATE C1R4MTSC FROM ecls GIVEN p1chlaud=0.00 TIMES 500 Save to simulate-C1R4MTSC-p1chlaud=0.png
    PLOT SIMULATE C1R4MTSC FROM ecls GIVEN p1chlaud=100.00 TIMES 500 Save to simulate-C1R4MTSC-p1chlaud=100.png

    PLOT SIMULATE C1R4MTSC FROM ecls GIVEN p1chlboo=0.00 TIMES 500 Save to simulate-C1R4MTSC-p1chlboo=0.png

<center>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cs_eccls/ecls_comparison_books.png" class="img-med" alt="Math outcomes given number of books">
</center>

Larger numbers of tapes and CDs and larger numbers of books are both associated with higher scores. Indeed, our finding regarding books agrees with previous research showing that children that grow up around large numbers of books tend to attain greater degrees of education (Evans et al., 2010).
