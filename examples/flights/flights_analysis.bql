-- Create a fresh btable for the demo, and load in pre-existing samples
DROP BTABLE flights;
CREATE BTABLE flights FROM flights.csv;
LOAD MODELS flights_samples.pkl.gz INTO flights;

-- Do analysis
SELECT * FROM flights ORDER BY arrdelay;

INFER * FROM flights WITH CONFIDENCE 0.9 ORDER BY arrdelay;
SELECT *, similarity_to(4) FROM flights ORDER BY similarity_to(4);
