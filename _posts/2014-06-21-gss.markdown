According to economics research, homeowners engage more in community activities than renters. They are also more likely to vote, more likely to know the names of the local political representatives, and more likely to engage in civic activities  (DiPasquale, D., &amp; Glaeser, E. L., 1999). For this reason, homeowners have been labeled better citizens (DiPasquale, D., &amp; Glaeser, E. L., 1999; McCabe, 2013). 

We will revisit this analysis, making use of the General Social Survey (GSS). The GSS is a sociological survey that collects data on the demographic characteristics and attitudes of US residents. Among other things, it includes information on homeownership, moral attitudes, and criminal variables. We have started by loading a subset of the GSS data into BayesDB, created a btable, and analyzed the data. 

<!-- The General Social Survey (GSS) is a collection of demographic data as well as data on the social, moral, and political attitudes of Americans. 

We've already created a btable, `gss_pared`, from a subset of the full GSS dataset and analyzed the data.

## Are homeowners more likely to vote?

First we'll check whether the homeowners of 2012, like their predecessors, are more likely to vote than renters. Since we're using the 2012 GSS we'll investigate the relationship between `vote08` and `dwelown` variables. `vote08` is a categorical variable, where `1` indicates that the respondent voted in the 2008 presidential election, while `0` indicates that the did not. `dwelown` is also a categorical variable where `1` indicates that the respondent owns their home, and `2` indicates that the respondent rents their home.

First, for homeowners (`dwelown=1`),

and second, for renters (`dwelown=2`)

    PLOT SELECT vote08 FROM gss_pared where dwelown=2 SAVE TO votedwel_2.png;

<!-- |            |     vote08     |

|   mode2    |       2        |

| prob_mode3 | 0.131078224101 | -->

![Vote variable plotted for renters]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cs_gss/votedwel_2.png)

We see that 75% of homeowners voted while only 50% of renters voted, confirming the previous finding.

    PLOT SELECT owngun FROM gss_pared where dwelown=2;

|            |      owngun      |

|    type    |   multinomial    |
|   count    |       230        |

| prob_mode2 |  0.093023255814  |
| prob_mode3 | 0.00634249471459 |

Here, note that mode2 is 1 which is 'owns a firearm'. 22% of homewoners own a firearm while do 9% of renters. Overall, gun ownership has dropped since the 1999 study during which 52% of homeowners and 26% of renters owned guns. -->

## Are homeowners less likely to have been arrested?

In addition to voting, previous results suggest that homeowners are more likely to stay on the right side of the law.
To confirm that homeownership and criminality (or lack thereof) are related, we can check the probability of dependence. We focus on three criminality-related variables: having been arrested `arrest`, convicted of a crime `convictd`, or crack-cocaine use `evcrack`. For each variable, we will assess the probability of dependence, where values near 1 indicate a high probability of dependence between the pair of variables, whereas values near 0 indicate probable independence.

First, arrests:

    SELECT DEPENDENCE PROBABILITY OF dwelown WITH arrest FROM gss_pared LIMIT 1;

| row_id | dependence probability of dwelown with arrest |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
|   0    |                 0.166666666667                |

next, convictions:

    SELECT DEPENDENCE PROBABILITY OF dwelown WITH convictd FROM gss_pared LIMIT 1;

| row_id | dependence probability of dwelown with convictd |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
|   0    |                  0.104166666667                 |

and finally, crack-cocaine use:

    SELECT DEPENDENCE PROBABILITY OF dwelown WITH evcrack FROM gss_pared LIMIT 1;

| row_id | dependence probability of dwelown with evcrack |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|
|   0    |                     0.1875                     |

The probability of dependence between homeownership and criminality-related variables in each case is fairly low, which disagrees with previous findings. 

## Which variables are related to homeownership?

Given that the hypothesized variables are probably not dependent on homeownership, a natural question is which variables are? To answer this question, we can order the variables based on the probability of depndence with homeownership.

    ESTIMATE COLUMNS FROM gss_pared ORDER BY DEPENDENCE PROBABILITY WITH dwelown LIMIT 20;

|  column  | desc dependence probability with dwelown |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| dwelown  |                 1.0                 |

| posslqy  |                0.8125               |
|  relsp1  |                0.8125               |
|  condom  |            0.791666666667           |
| evstray  |            0.791666666667           |
| gender2  |            0.791666666667           |
| marital  |            0.791666666667           |
| matesex  |            0.791666666667           |
|  evwork  |                0.6875               |
| dwelling |            0.666666666667           |
| whoelse3 |            0.666666666667           |
| whoelse6 |            0.645833333333           |
| relatsex |            0.604166666667           |
|  vote08  |            0.583333333333           |
| fambudgt |            0.541666666667           |
| whoelse1 |            0.520833333333           |
| realinc  |            0.520833333333           |


We see that a respondent's homeownership status is related to his/her familial and relationship status (head of household, `rplace`, relation to the other members of the household, `relhh2`, `relate2`, `relsp1`; relationship status, `posslqy`, `marital`, condom useage `condom`, marital fidelity `evstray`, etc. These are all variants on the theme that homeownership is related to marital/relationship status. 

Further down the list, we see two interesting case with a middling probability of dependence---`fambudget` and `realinc`. Looking at extreme values of income we see a quantitative trend.

FIXME: picture

These results suggest that homeownership has non-trivial dependencies with budgetting and income. Ultimately, disentangling these effects from relationship status will be a bit involved, but it does suggest that homewownership is related to a set of dispositions including strong familial relationships, careful budgetting, and, of course, solid income.


<!--
From the GSS code book the `evstay` survey question asks:

>Have you ever had sex with someone other than your husband or wife while you were married?

Let's take a closer look at `evstray`. We are concerned with yes (1), no (2), and never married (3) responses.

 -->
 
<!--
The big difference between homeowners and renters is not in whther they have cheated, but in their marital status. `evstray=3` is much common for renters than homeowners, confirming the previous dependence between homeownership and marital status. 
-->

<!--
We can ask BayesDB to generate a set of plots showing the relationship between marital status (`marital`), fidelity, and homeownership.

    PLOT SELECT evstray, dwelown, marital FROM gss_pared SAVE TO stray_dewel_mar.png;

![The relationship between marital status, fidelity, and homeownership]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cs_gss/stray_dwel_mar.png)

The plot confirms this suspicion. The are very different trends in the marital statuses of homeowners and renters. A large portion of renters have never been married which in turn affects the value of `evstray` .

For now it seems that homeowners' good reputation remains intact.
