One of the main concerns in American health care is addressing *unwarranted variations* in quality: a disparity between the cost and outcomes of care. The cost-care disparity is well-documented mainly as a result of the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, a freely available dataset which

>...uses Medicare data to provide information and analysis about national, regional, and local markets, as well as hospitals and their affiliated physicians

Where initially, these findings were produced and reported by teams of researchers after months of work, we shall use BayesDB to verify these results in a few commands.

### Unwarranted variations in aggregate

First, we create a btable and load in pre-computed models,

    CREATE BTABLE dha FROM dha.csv;
    LOAD MODELS dha_models.pkl.gz INTO dha;

The first thing to do is to is get a general sense of the data by creating a column dependence probability matrix in which each cell represents a pair of variables and the value represents the probability of their being statistically dependent under the inferred CrossCat model.

    ESTIMATE PAIRWISE DEPENDENCE PROBABILITY FROM dha SAVE TO dha_z.png;

![Dartmouth Atlas of Health z-matrix]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cs_dha/dha_z.png)

Notice that quality and cost show no dependence.  We can list the variables that share the most dependence with quality,

    ESTIMATE COLUMNS FROM dha ORDER BY DEPENDENCE PROBABILITY WITH qual_score LIMIT 10

|      column     | desc dependence probability with qual_score |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
|    ami_score    |                     -1.0                    |
|    qual_score   |                     -1.0                    |
|   pneum_score   |                     -1.0                    |
|    chf_score    |                     -1.0                    |
|  mdcr_spnd_hspc |                     -0.3                    |
|  pct_dths_hspc  |                     -0.3                    |
| hspc_days_p_dcd |                     -0.3                    |
|  mdcr_spnd_eqp  |                     -0.2                    |
| eqp_copay_p_dcd |                     -0.2                    |
|  mdcr_spnd_home |                     -0.1                    |

It appears that the other `_score` variables and quality score are dependent related and Medicare expenditures, deaths, and days show a weak dependence probability with the quality score.

### Unwarranted variations on a per-town basis

Which hospitals are most anomalous? This is, which hospitals have the least probable quality scores given their other features?

    SELECT name,  PREDICTIVE PROBABILITY OF qual_score FROM dha ORDER BY PREDICTIVE PROBABILITY OF qual_score ASC LIMIT 10

| row_id |        name       | predictive probability qual_score |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
|  161   |     McAllen TX    |         0.000305809830999         |
|   79   |     Elyria OH     |          0.0386015426914          |
|  171   |      Minot ND     |          0.0408746077354          |
|  152   |     Lubbock TX    |          0.0686783885467          |
|  185   |  New Brunswick NJ |          0.0817273108102          |
|   94   |     Fresno CA     |          0.0872660495903          |
|  175   |     Monroe LA     |          0.0880447645968          |
|  124   |     Jackson TN    |          0.0901135638775          |
|  239   | San Bernardino CA |          0.0923877470568          |
|   76   |     El Paso TX    |           0.094225198692          |

Here McAllen, Texas has a predictive probability orders of magnitide lower than the others. McAllen is a notoriously odd town when it comes to healthcare. In fact, the oddness of McAllen has been documented by the popular press ([The NewYorker](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande), [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-town-at-center-of-healthcare-debate/) and [NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/10/152417875/recalculating-the-health-bill-in-mcallen-texas)).
